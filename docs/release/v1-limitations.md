# v1.0 Limitations — Gate 9 Reference

*The single authoritative list for release-rehearsal Gate 9 ("confirm the
v1.0 limitations section"). Each item links to its governing record. Changes
require updating the governing record first, then this page.*

| # | Limitation | Governing record |
|---|------------|------------------|
| 1 | **Hardware** — no validated real-hardware deployment; the VisionFive 2 profile is provisional and was never booted on silicon | Errata **E-004** (ACCEPTED); `docs/deployment/starfive-visionfive2.md` TODOs |
| 2 | **Multi-hart** — the kernel runs single-hart; SMP scheduling, per-hart locking (e.g. the console spinlock), and IPIs are deferred to the multi-hart milestone | v1.0 design decision; `crates/fjell-kernel/src/console.rs` invariant note |
| 3 | **POSIX** — no POSIX compatibility surface (descriptors, fork, signals, ttys) | Non-goal **N1** |
| 4 | **Kernel-IPC for the SDK reference service** — the SDK reference service does not operate over live kernel-mediated IPC | Non-goal **N21** |
| 5 | **ZeroizeOnDrop** — no independently verified byte-level key-erasure guarantee | Non-goal **N23** |
| 6 | **Trust-anchor provisioning** — no ratified provisioning mechanism; design options (TOFU / factory station / hardware-anchored) await the architect decision | **RFC-v0.17-001** §4/§6 (proposed) |

Additional operational notes (not Gate 9 items, listed for completeness):

- All nine **QEMU negative-test categories are placeholders** (RFC 025
  §chicken-and-egg): `qemu-negative <cat>` reports PASS without booting
  QEMU. test-all tiers 10–18 therefore do not yet provide fault-injection
  coverage; implementing real negative profiles is post-v1.0 roadmap work.

- Several services in the QEMU image are **smoke-test stubs** that signal
  ready and exit by design (`fjell-netd`, `fjell-secure-transportd`,
  `fjell-driver-virtio-net`, `fjell-proxy-text`, `fjell-driver-virtio-blk`,
  `fjell-powerd`, among others). Their full implementations are tracked on
  the post-v1.0 roadmap; their early-exit pattern is intentional.
- The repro-check baseline (`tests/repro/baseline-digests.txt`) tracks the
  committed `prebuilt/*.bin` artefacts and must be re-recorded whenever the
  prebuilt service binaries are rebuilt — see `tools/fjell-repro-check`.
